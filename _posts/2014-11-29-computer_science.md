In this title, i will talk about my major that i choose to study in university. I choose computer science because i love to play game and also i want to be a programmer, so this is the reason that i choose to study in computer science. Computer Science teach me a lot in many terms such as working hard. In computer science, it is very difficult at the beginning or when you start to do something new(like me, i start to create my own blog), but when you know it, it will become easy. In addition, another reason that  i study in this role is that i think in the future everything will contain computer and the market will need a lot programmer, so i think it will be good for me to work in this role as well.




### This is an example of my works

1.)It is about how to Exploit Window Server 2003 by using Metasploit that i did with my friend or you can go to see by [Click-Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wYvjVEw2W4)

2.) I create my own photo hunt program for the project in Numerical Method(if i have time i will put it on my github)

3.) i also creat minecraft strike(it is like counter strike, but it is in minecraft) (if i have time i will put it on my github)

> So i hope that you guys will interest to join **computer science** role, and trust me it is very fun and it will be benefit to you!
