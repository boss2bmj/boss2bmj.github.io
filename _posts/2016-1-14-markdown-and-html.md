Hola, it means "hi" in english. In 2010, i was an exchange student from [AFS Intercultural Programs](https://www.afsthailand.org/) (or AFS, originally the American Field Service) between Thailand and Panama. I had to stay in Panama for one year, in order to exchange culture between Thai culture and Panama culture. In Panama, i lived in [Chepo](http://w0.fast-meteo.com/locationmaps/Chepo.8.gif) a small city in Panama, it is a farm city. At the first time, it was difficult time for me to adapt myself to this city, but when i stayed after one week, it is a very nice city, and i love it. I lived with Panamanian host family, there are 6 members in Panamanian family which are mom, sister, aunt, two brothers, and uncle. I love them very much because they are good to me, they taught me everything that i need to know about Panama, such as, they taught me how to cook Panama's food. I had learn a lot of Panama culture, for instance, the best thing that i learned there is "Spanish". My aunt(Panamanian) taught me how to use Spanish including (speak, write, listen, and read).

In Panama, i have two best friend which are [Stephan Lindau](https://www.facebook.com/stephan.lindau) & [Raven LaValle](https://www.facebook.com/ravenmaya?fref=ts). Stephan comes from Switzerland and Raven comes from the United State. Both of them are my super best friends when i was there, and both of them teach me a lot in term of language because both of them already know Spanish.
