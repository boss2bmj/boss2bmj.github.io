In my family, we really love to trvel very much especially my dad. He is a role model for me in terms of the head of the family, and when he works. In every long weekend, he always pick us to have some activity together such as going to the beach and so on. My favorite place that my dad picked me to is at Phuket, it is one of the southern provinces of Thailand, and it consists of the island of Phuket, the country's largest island. For me, i'm the person that really like to go to the beach very much because i love to play and stay chill at the beach, and it makes me relax all the time that i go. Futhermore, i'm very happy to have a wonderful time with my family.

In my family, there are 2 dogs that we love them very much, and the first one name is "Pen-tor" and another is "Por-jai". We named them same as the name charecter in "Pen-tor" series (at that time we love to watch "Pen-tor") Pen-tor and Por-jai lived with us 6 years ago.Pen-tor is a male dog and Por-jai is a female dog.<img class="img-rounded" id = "family_pic2" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/v/t1.0-9/557664_159781994149261_1284656781_n.jpg?oh=6b7ed614cc189e53a69ae77b96b1c08d&oe=57380CC5&__gda__=1464325267_b9440ddf5adcebcfd785f26e5b745645
" alt="boss" align="left" height = "200" /> Both of them is a sister and brother. I have a joke about my dad, at the first time, my dad does not like a dog, but when Pen-tor and Por-jai became a part of our family. He become a dog lover, and now he love both of them very much. He love them same as his son and daughter. Same as my dad, i love both of them very much, i think that they are not as a dog but they are my brother and sister.
