[One Piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by [Eiichiro Oda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiichiro_Oda) . This comic is all about the adventures of a young crazy man "[Monkey D. Luffy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_D._Luffy)" who want to be a pirate king. His body become a rubber because he unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit.  In order to be the pirate king, Luffy has to adventure and also between the adventure he also has more friends in there ship. In my point of view, i think that **One Picec** is the best manga right now, and i recommend you to read it!!.
