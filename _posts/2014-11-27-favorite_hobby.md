For me, i always do this three hobbies when i have a free time. When i have a free time, i will pick up my girlfriend or my friends to go eat or travel. In addition, somtimes if i have a free time, i usually like to watch movie, and my favorite movie is [About time](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194499/). It is a movie about the man who can travel through time and he can go fix thing in the past, but it will affect the future. In this movie, it teachs me that you have to do the best in the present and be happy with it. Like watch movie, i love to read comic books as well. Furthermore, the most favorite hobby that i love to do is going to have an exercise at gym.

#### My favorite hobby is go to gym

To begin with, i always go to the gym and exercise, and the reason that i love gym is that it makes me change a lot in term of body's shape, and it also teach me a lot of discipline. In my opinion, i'm very happy when i see my body change (more muscle). In the future, i really want to have my own gym.

In addition, i want to help people that do not know how to exercise, and i understand that when you want to start to exercise and you do not know, it makes you shy to do an exercise. So, i recommend you the best web site that when i start exercise i always go to look how to exercise is [www.bodybuilding.com](http://www.bodybuilding.com/)
